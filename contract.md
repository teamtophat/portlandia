# Communication Plan
Morning meetup - agile process. Use trello to organize tasks. Implement the 15 minute rule to ask for help. Talk on slack channel to keep everybody in the loop. Have a mid-day check-in before lunch and a check-in before we start again. Advocate for each other, and check in with how we’re feeling.

Come in Monday with as specific wireframe functionality as possible. 

## Conflict Plan
If we have a conflict, talk to somebody else in the group and see if they agree. Vocalize within the group and keep each other up to date. Take breaks if we’re all feeling anxiety. Depending on how critical a piece is to the app as the whole, make decisions based on prioritizing. 

From the beginning, have a list of the absolute musts and another list of extra bells and whistles. 

## Work Plan
For identifying and assigning tasks - use trello. Break everything down into small bits - by page, by smaller functions within pages. Assign tasks after we have fleshed out the visuals on whiteboard. Work in “vertical slices” and work together when there’s a larger part we are 

## Git Process
We’ll all pull together from the master branch, and check in with each other before merging. Make decisions on which changes to keep and give each other feedback on changes. Have pre-merge feedback during our morning meetups. Pull the master at the end of each day to make sure we stay on the same master branch. Close the pull requests in the mornings. Have our names in each branch name!
