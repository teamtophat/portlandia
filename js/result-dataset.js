You’re just too mainstream to be a considered a full fledged Portlander, maybe come back in a few years, when Portland rent prices have caused everyone to move out but Californians. Please don’t comeback anytime soon.'

In order fulfil your prophecy in this city, we suggest you go to hip coffee shops on the eastside, drink out of mason jars, and invest the best 90s fixie bike. Good Luck.'
