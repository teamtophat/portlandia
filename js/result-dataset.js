You’re just too mainstream to be a considered a full fledged Portlander, maybe come back in a few years, when Portland rent prices have caused everyone to move out but Californians. Please don’t come anytime soon.'

    description: 'Unfortunately, you are not Portland enough. You are paleo but don’t do yoga. You take Ubers rather bike, and you probably buy from Whole Foods rather than the Farmers Markets. In order fulfil your prophecy in this city, we suggest you go to hip coffee shops on the eastside, drink out of mason jars, and invest the best 90s fixie bike. Good Luck.'
