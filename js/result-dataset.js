You’re just too mainstream to be considered a full fledged Portlander. Maybe come back in a few years when Portland rent prices have caused everyone to move out except for Californians. Please don’t comeback anytime soon.'

In order to fulfill your prophecy in this city we suggest you go to hip coffee shops on the East Side, drink out of Mason jars, and invest in the best 90\'s fixie bike. Good luck!'
